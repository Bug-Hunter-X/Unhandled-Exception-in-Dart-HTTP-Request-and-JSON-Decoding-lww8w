# Unhandled Exception in Dart HTTP Request and JSON Decoding

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving HTTP requests and JSON decoding.  The `bug.dart` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

The original code lacks proper error handling for HTTP requests and JSON parsing, which can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior. The improved version incorporates robust error handling, including checks for HTTP status codes and exceptions during JSON decoding.
